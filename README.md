| Hyperparameter            	| Value   	|
|---------------------------	|---------	|

**What range of values were considered for the above parameters?**
<!-- Briefly describe the ranges of values that were considered for each
parameter, and the metrics and dataset used to select from the values. -->
We experimented a little bit with the hyperparameters of PPO, but the results did not
change drastically. Therefore, we did not perform any Hyperparameter Optimization.

**Is the policy deterministic?:** No
<!-- Whether the (state, action) policy is deterministic, yes/no. -->

## Description
<!-- A brief summary of the approach. Please try to be sufficiently descriptive
such that someone could replicate your approach. Insert links to external sites,
publications, images, or other pages where relevant. -->

Our Model uses the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Architecture:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347

### Training
We used a wrapper to extend the state space such that the number of remaining steps in
an additional entry in the state space (as a number, not one hot encoded). During
training, we limited the number of steps per episode to 200. We trained the PPO Model on all benchmarks
except ghostscript. Therefore, the model is not tested on unseen programs, except ghostscript.
The performance of ghostscript indicates potential for generalization to unseen programs as it is better
than the baseline compiler and most other techniques on the leaderboard.

We trained for 10 hours on a consumer computer and evaluated performance every half hour using only cpu in a docker
on windows. The peak performance was reached after 7 hours.
The exact specification is: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-9600K CPU @ 3.70GHz 3.70 GHz, 32GB RAM

### Guided Search
In a second step we use the action probabilities of the model to perform a guided
random search (also for 200 steps). We limited the search time to one minute for each
environment.

In a third step we optimized the best trajectory found during random search by taking 500
additional steps using the models action probabilities. This did not yield improvement
for all environments, but sometimes improved solution a little with basically no
computational cost. Therefore, the maximum possible length of a trajectory is 700.
However, most trajectories are much shorter.

We excluded the ghostscript benchmark during training since it took a lot of computation
and presented itself as a bottleneck. Additionally, we excluded the random search and additional
steps for this benchmark since it did not yield any improvement and drastically increased the mean
walltime.

## Reproduction
The following commands can be used to train the PPO Model. To exactly reproduce our experiment, ghostscript has
to be excluded from the benchmark file.
```sh
benchmarks = []
f = open("cbench-v1.txt", "r")
for line in f:
    benchmarks.append(line.strip())
f.close()

env = llvm_wrapper(benchmarks, max_episode_steps=200, steps_in_observation=True)

ppo_training = PPO(env)
ppo_training.train(log_progress=True, training_time=60 * 60 * 10, progress_log_rate=60 * 30)
Evaluation.evaluate(benchmarks, "default", additional_steps_for_max=500, max_trials_per_benchmark=100000,
                    max_time_per_benchmark=60 * 1)
```
